			<!-- start of interview -->
<p><b>How is art making online different then art making offline?</b></p>
<p> Art making offline can seem more organic and create a different texture and feel whereas art making online although cool, may sometimes come off as very smooth.
</p>

<p><b> How has your view of the internet / how you experience being online changed over time?</b></p>
<p> The interface has changed drastically over time due to the rapidly evolving technology. Although the technology and the internet has become more complex it seems like the interface has become more simple to navigate. </p>

<p><b> How does the web impact graphic design? </b></p>
<p> Graphic design has adapted to the web to an extent where graphic design has become synonymous with the web and technology.</p>
