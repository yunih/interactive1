<p> Art making offline can seem more organic and create a different texture and feel whereas art making online although cool, may sometimes come off as very smooth.
</p>

<h3> How has your view of the internet / how you experience being online changed over time?</h3>
<p> The interface has changed drastically over time due to the rapidly evolving technology. Although the technology and the internet has become more complex it seems like the interface has become more simple to navigate. </p>
